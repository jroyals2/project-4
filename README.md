This project I really wanted to showcase how to use active record to make a more complicated relationshipsand render them dynamically through react. I also wanted to use Devise to create a secure log in and user data.  The technologies I used in this project are

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* React
* Node.JS
* Several Libaries Including 
    - Devise
    - Styled Components
    - Foreman
    - CanCanCan
    - Axios
    - HTTParty
I also used an outside weather API for this project at https://openweathermap.org/current

In the future I want to add admin functionality to the website and bring in an API that can pull a list of sporting events in a local area to show to a user of the website.
